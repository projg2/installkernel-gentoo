.TH INSTALLKERNEL 8 "2019-12-06" "Gentoo Linux"
.SH NAME
installkernel \- install a new kernel image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "installkernel " "version zImage System.map [directory]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B installkernel
installs a new kernel image onto the system from the Linux source
tree.  It is called by the Linux kernel makefiles when
.B make install
is invoked there.
.P
The new kernel is installed into
.IR {directory}/vmlinuz-{version} .
If a symbolic link
.I {directory}/vmlinuz
already exists, it is refreshed by making a link from
.I {directory}/vmlinuz
to the new kernel, and the previously installed kernel is available as
.IR {directory}/vmlinuz.old .
.P
In addition to that,
.I System.map
passed on the command-line is installed using the same logic.
If the directory containing
.I System.map
contains
.I .config
file, it is also installed.  If the directory containing
.I zImage
contains
.I initrd
file, it is also installed.
.SH BUGS
installkernel resides in /sbin only because the Linux kernel makefiles
call it from there.  It should really be in /usr/sbin.  It isn't
needed to boot a system.
